# CSS Tooltip Demo

This project demonstrates how to create interactive tooltips using pure CSS. Tooltips appear when a user hovers over specific elements, offering additional information in a clean and accessible way.

Features:

- CSS-only implementation
- Smooth transitions and pointer arrows
- Responsive layout
- Includes five examples

Technologies:

- HTML
- CSS (Pseudo-elements, Custom properties)

How it works:

Each element includes a data-tooltip attribute. Tooltip text and styling are applied using ::before and ::after pseudo-elements, with CSS variables controlling color, scale, and transitions.

File structure:

/css-tooltips
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── README.md

Instructions:

1. Download or clone the project.
2. Open index.html in your browser.
3. Hover over the elements to see the tooltips in action.
